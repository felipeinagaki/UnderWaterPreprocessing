# Computer Vision Preprocessing Project

This repository contains the code to reproduce the preprocessing results for the Computer Vision Project titled "....". Our team chose the Wavelet method for preprocessing.

## Folder Structure

- **Wavelet_Method**: This folder contains the implementation of the Wavelet preprocessing method.
- **Other_Preprocessing_algorithms**: This folder includes all other preprocessing methods we tested during the project.

## How to Run the Code

To run the code for the chosen method (Wavelet), please refer to the notebook `Wavelet_PreProcess.ipynb`.

For descriptions of the other methods used, as well as instructions on how to run those codes, please check the README in the `Other_Preprocessing_algorithms` folder.

The code for the Wavelet method is originally available on the official GitHub repository at [https://github.com/ZZiyin/UIE-WD_Code]
